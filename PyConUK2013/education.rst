Teachers aren't getting much in the way of training to implement the new cirriculum - they need help.  Often get a 1 day course in Python and then expected to teach it, and teach others.

Many schools don't have computer rooms any more.  Instead:

- snap on iPad
- scratch on android, anything
- python anywhere in your browser

Code camps?

- hard to get *lots* of teachers at a weekend
- weekday CPD (continuing professional development) easier to do
- code camp in holiday, teachers can bring kids
