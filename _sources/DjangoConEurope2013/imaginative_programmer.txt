The Imaginative Programmer
--------------------------

stories

design education is broken

(funny) rants about not being taken seriously in one area because of 
something else he does (often programming)

> I propose we hack creativity and make it worthless

4 types

* no imagination, technique - stereotype of nerd programmer
* imagination, no technique - biz dreamer
* no imagination, no technique - doesn't exist
* imagination, technique - the goal

Process

1. imagine - problem, "itch"
2. establish a concept - some form of constraint
3. research technologies and tools - do research or you'll pay later
4. Regine the Concept Through Composition - mark what's in and what's out
5. Explore through prototype - work on paper, throw away code
6. Make it Real

We are programmers, everything is recursize 

'top down' v 'bottom up' is really 'concept' v 'technique'

- take a notebook with you (email ideas to yourself)
- fear of failure is the biggest killer of new ideas
- create a 'place' or a trigger that gives you permission to fail
- beginning of critical thinking in composition, definite after
  prototype
- talk to others about your ideas help, solitude best for dev ideas
