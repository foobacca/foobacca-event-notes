State of the CMS in Django
==========================

Iacopo Spalletti - Django CMS
Tom Dyson - Wagtail

Django CMS
----------

Four main users

- developer
- front end dev
- Power editor
- low level editors

- Use ORM in fancy, non-trivial way
- Django CMS - editing built on the flexibility of the admin (though the admin is hidden from editors)
- url conf is a pain point - bit abused by the way URLs hooked in

Wagtail
-------

- seeking to remove control from power editors
- done a lot of work in Drupal as well
- focussed on Django developers - standard Django stuff
- focussed on performance

Discussion
----------

front end development

communicate properly with the community eg CMS removed features 2.4 -> 3.0

wordpress style success?!

- deployment is harder for any django project
- aldryn is providing CMS-as-a-service
- themes are good for widely used projects
- wordpress ease of administration is so much easier - that's a big barrier to wide adoption
