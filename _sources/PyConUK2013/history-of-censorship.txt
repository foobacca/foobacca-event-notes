Why this talk
=============

* http://asofterworld.com - web comic, dark sense of humour, talks about sex
* censored by mobile dongle service

History
=======

Tyndale Bible
-------------

* first English translation of bible which was mass produced
* thousands of copies burnt
* Tyndale hounded out of England
* eventually captured, strangled, burnt

Star Chamber
------------

* Rich and powerful couldn't be touched.
* Star chamber chaired by king, so could get everyone below
* all secret (including laws ...)
* no right to appeal etc
* kings (Henry VII, Charles I) turn it into vicous, brutal, arbitrary court
* all books have to pre-approved/pre-censored
* 1643 Licensing Act

John Milton - Areopagitica
--------------------------

In response: John Milton - Areopagitica (speech to parliament)

* it won't work
* unintended harmful consequences for society - you will censor more than is good

20 years later, without any big crisis, censorship fades away

John Stewart Mill
-----------------

* humans are fallible - we can't be sure that what we oppose is actually wrong
* humans are ...

so, don't censor

The Present
===========

Filtering
---------

* default-on network-level adult content filters
* filters will be on in any places where children might be present

"adult content" - talk about sex, sexual health, drugs, "extremist" sites

current filters - over block, easy to circumvent, run by private companies, no appeal or redress

"any places where children might be present" - not phone, not home. It is hotels, coffee shop, museum, libraries, trains - "the commons"

What can you do?
----------------

* Open Rights Group are "most plausible" group on these issues
* http://writetothem.com - write to your MP
* Andrews & Arnold Ltd - only UK ISP who refuse to filter at network level
* replace the internet !! (medium term goal)
