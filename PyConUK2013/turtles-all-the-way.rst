========================
Turtles all the way down
========================

* Simon Davy

Want to be able to:

* traffic simulation with many turtles
* games ...

Inspired by last year's education track

* STEM ambassador, hard to get kids engaged
* core mechanic
* computer science

Let's try

* 50 turtles doing a random walk - too much CPU
* https://github.com/AllTheWayDown/TurGLES - use GPU - can now do 1000 easily, can handle 50000 on a modern powerful laptop!
* turtle.py - 1 file, 4100+ lines, no tests
* https://github.com/AllTheWayDown/NinjaTurtle - reimplementation, not finished
* still needed - collision detection, sensors, time sliced execution env, high level API for user
* https://github.com/AllTheWayDown/turtlepower
* asteroids in turtle language
* don't want to have to teach classes for students

Plans

* TurGLES - better ES2 renderer, drawing, borders, undo
* NinjaTurtle - more tests, faster maths
* TurtlePower - just getting started, build engine, APIs, work w both stdlib and Ninja/TurGLES
* Usage: aim usable form early 2014, work w teachers for some example lesson plans, real world testing in local schools!
* sprinting on Monday
