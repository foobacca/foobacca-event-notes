this talk is about why "Django is awesome"

1. django is everywhere
2. python has a style guide (and the zen of python)
3. awesome API - understandable, conventions (though boring)
    - pro-tip: while Fat Models are great, they can become obese -> break code into helper functions
    - api conventions encourage clean design
    - we don't fight about architecture, get things done
4. django views are functions
5. awesome longevity
    - slow deprecation
6. awesome features
    - admin ...
    - pro-tip: django.contrib.admin + NoSQL - DON'T DO IT - write from scratch
7. Django's full stack is awesome
    - dominates hackathons
    - lots of companies just use stock Django/python and nothing else
8. 3rd party package ecosystem
9. awesome documentation
10. django is humble
    - critical talks, shape the code, shape the community
11. generosity
