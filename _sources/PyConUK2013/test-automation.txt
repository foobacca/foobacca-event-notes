Method: Activity-Testing Pattern
================================

Multiple abstraction levels

* Rule, intention of test (most clear, most stable)
* Workflow
* Technical Activity (least clear, stable)

emphasis of scope over form
===========================

* large tests (high complexity, effort, confidence in whole system)
* medium tests
* small tests (high number, isolation, speed, confidence in specific change)
