============================================

What is user testing

- make someone use your web application
- see what happens
- learn stuff and make it better
- techniques are 15 years old
- Steve Krug books are excellent
- also - "the design of everyday things" - book

Why?

- gives a fresh perspective
- do your users understand what's going on
- find small changes that will make a big difference to users

When to test?

-  before you build something

  - solve the right problem
  - competitors
  - wireframs

- early versions
- in production
- cheaper to make changes early
- recommendation - do it once per month

How to find participants

- anyone ... not on your team
- don't try to find perfect participant
- aim for mix of beginners and experts - don't need to have all with domain knowledge
- compensate your participants

How to test

- many ways, here is one:
- 50 minutes per participant
- 3 participants per session
- test room and observation room
- test room

  - participant, facilitator, laptop/phone, list of tasks
  - not testing user, testing app
  - encourage them to think allowed
  - show them the landing page - ask them to say what they see
  - give task
  - avoid helping/answering questions unless they are really stuck

    - answer questions at end

  - repeat until tasks done

- observation room

  - team, stakeholders, snacks, big screen, paper/whiteboard
  - each observer, write top 3 things to change

- screenshare between rooms - skype, hangouts

tips

- try to use realistic data
- ask participant if any questions

after

- discuss findings
- agree top priorities
- list of low hanging fruit
- plan the next session

Repeat

- each session will find the most important issues
- fix them before next test
- find next most important issues

remote user testing

- screen sharing while participant at home
- tech issues
- OR go to participant's workplace - but travel for you

unmoderated remote testing

- pay someone to try, record video
