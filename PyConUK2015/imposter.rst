Wikipedia definition:

  Impostor syndrome is a psychological phenomenon in which people are unable to internalize their accomplishments.
  
  Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not deserve the success they have achieved.
  
  Notably, impostor syndrome is particularly common among high-achieving women.

The above definition implies "highly strung crazy woman" - no recognition of role of society in how this arises.

Alternative definition:

  Imposter syndrome is a social condition in which people have internalised society's negative perjudices against thme.
  
  Despite external evidence of their competence, those with the syndrome remain convinced that they are frauds and do not percieve the recognition they recieve.  (might have misremembered the details of this line)
  
  Notably, impostor syndrome is particularly common among high-achieving people in marginalised groups.

How to deal with it:

* recognise it
* be fair

  * don't compare your bad with their good
  * own your strengths and achievements
  * "we're all bozos on this bus"

* be authentic

  * you can't be outed if you're already out
  * (this can be very hard)

* support yourself

  * look for a safe network
  * (create one if you have to)

* Focus on your values

  * proven to work against "stereotype threat"

    * experiment - tell them "women don't do well at maths", then write an essay on your values

* Small steps; practice

Being authentic can be very hard; it **is** risky

Beats the hell out of being an imposter

Questions
---------

For those with power, how to make things a bit better?

* encourage everyone to admit ignorance, mistakes
* don't talk about rock stars, ninjas, "10x programmer" ...
* don't put people in fixed roles - crap/good
* don't ask people who are unusual "how did you come to be here" -> it reinforces the outsider perspective
