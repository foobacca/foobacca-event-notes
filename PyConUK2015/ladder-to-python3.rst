Rant about being asked to backport python 3 projects to python 2

If you maintain open source, move to support python 2 and 3 in codebase

As well as 2to3, you can develop in python 3 and use 3to2 to backport to python 2

For CentOS 6 users, you can use https://wiki.centos.org/AdditionalResources/Repositories/SCL to get supported python 3 packages

python-future library - auto import and convert python 2 libraries to use in python 3
