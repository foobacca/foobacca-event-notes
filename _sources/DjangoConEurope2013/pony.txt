Having your pony and committing it too
--------------------------------------

* Jacob Burch

Basically, getting commits accepted into core django

'Max Weber describes politics as "the slow boring of hard boards". Open Source is the same.'

* passion and perspective
* be on top of things and be patient
* confident and humble

First:

* fork https://github.com/django/django/ 
* git clone
* ./runtests.py --settings=test\_sqlite 
* Do not pass GO until tests run

bug fix:

* start with a test case - very important 
* test against regressions 
* not necessarily free from discussion

major contributions (and tbh, minor additions)

* search trac 
* search django-developers 
* become familiar with the code in the area you're changing

proposing a change

* be humble 
* expect it to take a while 
* respect the coding style 
* have tests

Review

* your ego is *not* on the line 
* humility - no really 
* you are not your code 
* patience 
* pro-active - send polite, friendly follow up messages often
