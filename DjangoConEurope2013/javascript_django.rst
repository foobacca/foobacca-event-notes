Combine JS and Django
---------------------

use JS frameworks - app structure, testability, productivity

why not backbone? 

* lack of bindings 
* no reusable views 
* models are poor

trying angular and ember instead, not sure which will win

requireJS gives 

* easy Coffeescript integration 
* modular code 
* builder
* uglifier

* django-require gives coffeescript integration (similar to django-pipeline)
* django-rest-framework good
* django-storages - static files
