The advantages of diversity
---------------------------

- communities - watched what works well and doesn't over many years
- open source is great - building amazing software infrastructure

live in a multi-dimensional world

- often define line and put people along it
- but ultimately hard to ignore

good/bad, republican/democrat, python/ruby, friend/stranger, native/foreigner ...

"you always know where you are with a bigot"

issue is polarisation

- good = preferred value
- bad = any other value

Venn-diagram world view - still either inside or outside

tolerance

- requires respect for others point of view
- value range of opinions
- "you tell me your truth and I'll tell you mine" Bevan
- admit we might be wrong occasionally

open source not representative

- even of tech industry
- some feel this is fine, more comfortable
- yet ignores huge swathes of people who could help
- a project's single greatest asset is its people

if we're not welcoming, we're exclusionary

we're all limited, danger of groupthink

programmers tend to ignore roles outside of s/w dev and design

- docs - django stands out, even python docs could be a lot better
- plenty of other important roles to round out large tech projects
- expand diversity to help us fill the roles

open source projects are generally not professionally run

python website update coming - make it easier for contributors to update the sections they contribute to

we do have a good community, but need to avoid being smug and complacent
