Possibilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* li'l data - the teensy - $19, board with 32 bit ARM chip, tiny
* analogy with body - sensors interating with world, feeding data into cloud
* how to bridge the gap? (otherwise your app is a "brain in a tank")
* eg bergcloud - small thermal printer that talks to cloud and prints your info for the day
* twilio - send information by SMS

demo

- chips - arduino, gsm modem, rfid reader
- connect to laptop using USB
- read rfid, send tag id over SMS
- go via twilio to django app
- django sends message to foursquare

personal development
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

-  everyone thinks that they are "above average" (doning/kruger effect
   (mis spelt))
-  confidence drops as you get better - "shit, there is so much to
   learn, I know nothing"
-  "Burnout is caused when you repeatedly make large amounts of
   sacrifice and or effort into high-risk problems that fail. It's the
   result of a negative prediction error in the nucleus accumbens. You
   effectively condition your brain to associate work with failure." -
   Isaac Yonemoto

* gap between tutorials and reference material
* can hit the wall when getting to intermediate leveI
* learn how to help people past the middle level
