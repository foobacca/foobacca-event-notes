Lightning Talks Day 1
=====================

I am a doctor
-------------

Dr Russel Kieth-McGee

Django Core Team, President of DSF
Ticket ID - "Dork One"
Founder of BeeWare project and Toga(?)
Startup ... cloud tree?

Doctor of Computer Science - This is not medical advice

Stress, lots of balls in the air - became "an angry man"
Lost enthusiasm, confidence
Health issues
Rollercoaster
Few weeks ago hit rock bottom - diagnosed as in Major Depressive episode - started treatment

I put off getting help for far too long
didn't want to admit to stigma of mental illness
our industry causes problems - burnout is constantly talked about

Don't ignore the signs (in yourself or others), seek help

The first software engineer
---------------------------

Andrew Godwin

Margaret Hamilton, 1969
Wrote code for Apollo 11 Landing Modules - lead developer
coined term "software engineer"
mission was almost complete failure - apart from software
landing radar - how high are you?  etc
small computer on landing module
rendezvous radar at the other end - to link up to go home
computer can't handle both radars - but rendezvous radar turned on during landing
computer overloaded, was about to shutdown
manual abort, manual fly back

put prioritisation in, so it survived

"There was no second change, it has to work right first time"

expect failure, build for it, cause it

Notifications of login attempts
-------------------------------

Markus H

Jackson Rod sprint
------------------

Owen Campbell

- Join our sprint - jackson rod
- build django app on top of axelrod library
- axelrod is ...
- 1859 - Darwin published Origin of Species
- but it struggled with cooperative behaviour - how to align with Survival of the Fittest
- 1951 - Axelrod and XXX - publish computer simulation of population - engage with each other in simplified game, run over and over.  Showed cooperative behaviour can evolve
- Axelrod didn't publish his code - 2014 - Dr Vincent Knight started open source project to try to recreate Axelrod's tournament.
- pip install axelrod
- but library, so needs code to use it
- so we want a web app on top of it, so anyone can play with it, and see the results

Scraping with Selenium
----------------------

Arthur Johnston

- New to python (from PHP)
- project to document everywhere dogs are welcome
- scrapy is a great package for web scraping
- trip advisor has javascript to scramble lots of things - phone numbers ...
- so changed to use selenium, wait for page load, select by CSS selector once JS done
- can even wait for redirects

FinTech = Financial Tech World
business loan process is heavy, so 5M businesses want loans but can't get them
so automate business loan process
