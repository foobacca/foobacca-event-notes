Principle Philosophy
--------------------

- thoughts about the rules or belief governing one's behaviour
- how can I be a good person?
- how can I be a good programmer?

- logic?
- black and white rules?

Immanuel Kant

- reason vs instinct
- moral obligations
    - duty
    - the goal / volition
    - universal lawfulness

priori vs posteriori (principles vs experience)

we are the sum of our experiences

- so add to our experiences
- network experiences - shared by others eg at DjangoCon
- "everything looks different from the trenches"

story

- hated little league baseball, crap at it
- parents said had to play
- monetary incentive - home run = money
- worked out was doing it to keep parent's happy - duty - not entirely bad thing

lesson learned

- swing for the fences
    - big vision/dream, motivated, big risks
    - hacker league
- set reasonable goals along the way
- you suck ... and that's totally OK
- quitting is easy - I've done it thousands of times - who the hell knows -> at least try your best before giving up. persistence is a good thing

- build principles
- one size doesn't fit all
- learn from experiences and share them
- ...
